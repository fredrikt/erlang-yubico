Erlang-Yubico

Client implementing the Yubico Validation Protocol Version 2.0.

Quick example :

   1) get an API key and ID from

         https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/

      say you got id "87" and secret "Wyhz6s2KQeipM6fxLc2nBHR5uNQ=".

   2) run 'erlc *.erl; erl' to compile the client source and start
      an Erlang shell.

   3) Try to validate an OTP from your Yubikey :

      Eshell V5.7.4  (abort with ^G)
      1> yubico:simple_verify("vvvvvvcucrlcietctckflvnncdgckubflugerlnr", "87", "tXCs0HUt4IyRhQB8pn7oeO3o6RQ=", []).
      {auth,ok}
      2> 

      Try to validate the SAME OTP again (supposed to fail, obviously)

      2> yubico:simple_verify("vvvvvvcucrlcietctckflvnncdgckubflugerlnr", "87", "tXCs0HUt4IyRhQB8pn7oeO3o6RQ=", []).
      {bad_auth,replayed_otp}
      3> 

See the documentation at the top of yubico.erl for more information.
